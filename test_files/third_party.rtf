\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Copyright law is complex, OpenBSD* policy is simple - OpenBSD strives to maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix copyrights.\par
OpenBSD can exist as it does today because of the example set by the Computer Systems Research Group at Berkeley and the battles which they and others fought to create a relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution.\par
The ability of a\cf0\~\b freely redistributable\b0\~\cf1 "Berkeley" Unix to move forward on a competitive basis with other operating systems depends on the willingness of the various development groups to exchange code amongst themselves and with other projects. Understanding the legal issues surrounding copyright is fundamental to the ability to exchange and re-distribute code, while honoring the spirit of the copyright and concept of attribution is fundamental to promoting the cooperation of the people involved.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Berkeley rescinded the 3rd term (the advertising term) on 22 July 1999. Verbatim copies of the Berkeley license in the OpenBSD tree have that term removed. In addition, many 3rd-party BSD-style licenses consist solely of the first two terms.\par
Because the OpenBSD copyright imposes no conditions beyond those imposed by the Berkeley copyright, OpenBSD can hope to share the same wide distribution and applicability as the Berkeley distributions. It follows however, that OpenBSD cannot include material which includes copyrights which are more restrictive than the Berkeley copyright, or must relegate this material to a secondary status, i.e. OpenBSD as a whole is freely redistributable, but some optional components may not be.\par

\pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\widctlpar\s3\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Copyright Law\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 While the overall subject of copyright law is far beyond the scope of this document, some basics are in order. Under the current copyright law, copyrights are implicit in the creation of a new work and reside with the creator, unless otherwise assigned. In general the copyright applies only to the new work, not the material the work was derived from, nor those portions of the derivative material included in the new work.\par
Copyright law admits to three general categories of works:\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Original Work\par
A new work that is not derived from an existing work.\par
Derivative Work\par
Work that is derived from, includes or amends existing works.\par
Compilations\par
A work that is a compilation of existing new and derivative works.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The fundamental concept is that there is primacy of the copyright, that is a copyright of a derivative work does not affect the rights held by the owner of the copyright of the original work, rather only the part added. Likewise the copyright of a compilation does not affect the rights of the owner of the included works, only the compilation as an entity.\par
It is vitally important to understand that copyrights are broad protections as defined by national and international copyright law. The "copyright notices" usually included in source files are not copyrights, but rather notices that a party asserts that they hold copyright to the material or to part of the material. Typically these notices are associated with license terms which grant permissions subject to copyright law and with disclaimers that state the position of the copyright holder/distributor with respect to liability surrounding use of the material.\par

\pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\widctlpar\s3\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Permissions - the flip side\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Because copyrights arise from the creation of a work, rather than through a registration process, there needs to be a practical way to extend permission to use a work beyond what might be allowed by "fair use" provisions of the copyright laws.\par
This permission typically takes the form of a "release" or "license" included in the work, which grants the additional uses beyond those granted by copyright law, usually subject to a variety of conditions. At one extreme sits "public domain" where the originator asserts that he imposes no restrictions on use of the material, at the other restrictive clauses that actually grant no additional rights or impose restrictive, discriminatory or impractical conditions on use of the work.\par
Again, an important point to note is that the release and conditions can only apply to the portion of the work that was originated by the copyright holder - the holder of a copyright on a derivative work can neither grant additional permissions for use of the original work, nor impose more restrictive conditions for use of that work.\par
Because copyright arises from the creation of a work and not the text or a registration process, removing or altering a copyright notice or associated release terms has no bearing on the existence of the copyright, rather all that is accomplished is to cast doubt upon whatever rights the person making the modifications had to use the material in the first place. Likewise, adding terms and conditions in conflict with the original terms and conditions does not supersede them, rather it casts doubts on the rights of the person making the amendments to use the material and creates confusion as to whether anyone can use the amended version or derivatives thereof.\par
Finally, releases are generally binding on the material that they are distributed with. This means that if the originator of a work distributes that work with a release granting certain permissions, those permissions apply as stated, without discrimination, to all persons legitimately possessing a copy of the work. That means that having granted a permission, the copyright holder can not retroactively say that an individual or class of individuals are no longer granted those permissions. Likewise should the copyright holder decide to "go commercial" he can not revoke permissions already granted for the use of the work as distributed, though he may impose more restrictive permissions in his future distributions of that work.\par

\pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\widctlpar\s3\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Specific Cases\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 This section attempts to summarize the position of OpenBSD relative to some commonly encountered copyrights.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Berkeley*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The Berkeley copyright is the model for the OpenBSD copyright. It retains the rights of the copyright holder, while imposing minimal conditions on the use of the copyrighted material. Material with Berkeley copyrights, or copyrights closely adhering to the Berkeley model can generally be included in OpenBSD.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 AT&T*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 As part of its settlement with AT&T*, Berkeley included an AT&T copyright notice on some of the files in 4.4BSD lite and lite2. The terms of this license are identical to the standard Berkeley license.\par
Additionally, OpenBSD includes some other AT&T code with non-restrictive copyrights, such as the reference implementation of\cf0\~{\cf1{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awk.tar.gz" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3 awk}}}}\cf1\f1\fs20 .\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Caldera*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Caldera* (now known as the SCO group) is the current owner of the Unix code copyrights. On 23 January 2002, the original Unix code (versions 1 through seven, including 32V) was freed by Caldera. This code is now available under a\cf0\~{\cf1{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3 4-term BSD-style license}}}}\cf1\f1\fs20 . As a result, it is now possible to incorporate real Unix code into OpenBSD (though this code is quite old and generally requires significant changes to bring it up to date).\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 DEC*, Sun*, other manufacturers/software houses.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 In general OpenBSD does not include material copyrighted by manufacturers or software houses. Material may be included where the copyright owner has granted general permission for reuse without conditions, with terms similar to the Berkeley copyright, or where the material is the product of an employee and the employer's copyright notice effectively releases any rights they might have to the work.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Carnegie-Mellon* (CMU, Mach)\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The Carnegie-Mellon copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except that it requests that derivative works be made available to Carnegie-Mellon. Because this is only a request and not a condition, such material can still be included in OpenBSD. It should be noted that existing versions of Mach are still subject to AT&T copyrights, which prevents the general distribution of Mach sources.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Apache*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The original Apache* copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except that it stipulates that products derived from the code may not have "Apache" in their name. The purpose of this clause is to avoid a situation in which another party releases a modified version of the code named in such a way to make users think that it is the "official" version. This is not an issue with OpenBSD because OpenBSD is a\cf0\~\b Compilation\cf1\b0 , and not a\cf0\~\b Derived Work\cf1\b0 . Source code published under version 2 of the Apache license cannot be included into OpenBSD. As a consequence, OpenBSD now maintains its own version of Apache based on version 1.3.29. The OpenBSD version includes many enhancements and bugfixes.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 ISC*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The ISC* copyright is functionally equivalent to a two-term BSD copyright with language removed that is made unnecessary by the Berne convention. This is the preferred license for new code incorporated into OpenBSD. A sample license is included in the source tree as\cf0\~{\cf1{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/share/misc/license.template?rev=HEAD" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\fs24 /usr/src/share/misc/license.template}}}}\cf1\f1\fs20 .\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 GNU* General Public License, GPL, LGPL, copyleft, etc.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 The GNU* Public License and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction that source code must be distributed or made available for all works that are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code.\par
While this may be a noble strategy in terms of software sharing, it is a condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software. As a consequence, software bound by the GPL terms can not be included in the kernel or "runtime" of OpenBSD, though software subject to GPL terms may be included as development tools or as part of the system that are "optional" as long as such use does not result in OpenBSD as a whole becoming subject to the GPL terms.\par
As an example, GCC and other GNU tools are included in the OpenBSD tool chain. However, it is quite possible to distribute a system for many applications without a tool chain, or the distributor can choose to include a tool chain as an optional bundle which conforms to the GPL terms.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 NetBSD*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Much of OpenBSD is originally based on and evolved from NetBSD*, since some of the OpenBSD developers were involved in the NetBSD project. The general NetBSD license terms are compatible with the Berkeley license and permit such use. Material subject\cf0\~\b only\b0\~\cf1 to the general NetBSD license can generally be included in OpenBSD.\par
In the past, NetBSD has included material copyrighted by individuals who have imposed license conditions beyond that of the general NetBSD license, but granted the NetBSD Foundation license to distribute the material. Such material can not be included in OpenBSD as long as the conditions imposed are at odds with the OpenBSD license terms or releases from those terms are offered on a discriminatory basis.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 FreeBSD*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Most of FreeBSD* is also based on Berkeley licensed material or includes copyright notices based on the Berkeley model. Such material can be included in OpenBSD, while those parts that are subject to GPL or various individual copyright terms that are at odds with the OpenBSD license can not be included in OpenBSD.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Linux*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Most of Linux* is subject to GPL style licensing terms and therefore can not be included in OpenBSD. Individual components may be eligible, subject to the terms of the originator's copyright notices. Note that Linux "distributions" may also be subject to additional copyright claims of the distributing organization, either as a compilation or on material included that is not part of the Linux core.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 X*, XFree86*, X.Org*\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 X*, X.Org* or XFree86* are not parts of OpenBSD, rather X.Org and parts of XFree86 3.3.6 are distributed with many OpenBSD ports as a convenience to the user, subject to applicable license terms.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Shareware, Charityware, Freeware, etc.\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 Most "shareware" copyright notices impose conditions for redistribution, use or visibility that are at conflict with the OpenBSD project goals. Review on a case-by-case basis is required as to whether the wording of the conditions is acceptable in terms of conditions being requested vs. demanded and whether the spirit of the conditions is compatible with goals of the OpenBSD project.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 Public Domain\par

\pard\widctlpar\li720\sb100\sa100 While material that is truly entered into the "Public Domain" can be included in OpenBSD, review is required on a case by case basis. Frequently the "public domain" assertion is made by someone who does not really hold all rights under Copyright law to grant that status or there are a variety of conditions imposed on use. For a work to be truly in the "Public Domain" all rights are abandoned and the material is offered without restrictions.\par

Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.\par
All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.\par

\pard\cbpat6\nowidctlpar\s3\sb420\sa300\sl240\slmult0\i Statement of Purpose\i0\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\sl240\slmult0 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").\par
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\par
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\par
\b\fs24 1. Copyright and Related Rights.\b0\~\fs20 A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\par

\pard\cbpat6 
{\pntext\f1 i.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf1\pnindent360\pnstart1\pnqr\pnlcrm{\pntxta.}}
\widctlpar\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa120\sl240\slmult0 the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\par
{\pntext\f1 ii.\tab}moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\par
{\pntext\f1 iii.\tab}publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\par
{\pntext\f1 iv.\tab}rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\par
{\pntext\f1 v.\tab}rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\par
{\pntext\f1 vi.\tab}database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\par
{\pntext\f1 vii.\tab}other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\sb100\sa100\sl240\slmult0\b\fs24 2. Waiver.\b0\~\fs20 To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\par
\b\fs24 3. Public License Fallback.\b0\~\fs20 Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\par

{\pntext\f1 b.\tab}Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\par
{\pntext\f1 c.\tab}Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\par

Agreement.\par
\par
3. LICENSE GRANT:\par
\par
A. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel\par
Corporation ("Intel") grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable\par
copyright license to make only the minimum number of copies of the\par
Materials reasonably necessary for your internal testing and\par
development of your products.\par
\par
B. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel\par
grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable copyright license to\par
modify the Materials that are provided in source code (human readable)\par

all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any specific\par
restrictions which may appear in the \ldblquote redist.txt\rdblquote  file, Intel grants to\par
you a non-exclusive, non-assignable copyright license to redistribute\par
the files (unmodified or modified by you) listed in the \ldblquote redist.txt\rdblquote\par
file only as part of the application you develop with the Materials.\par

\pard\cbpat6\nowidctlpar\s2\sa300\sl570\slmult0\cf4\f3 WiX Toolset License\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\sa300 The WiX toolset is released under the Microsoft Reciprocal License (MS-RL). A reciprocal license is used to ensure that others who build on the effort of the WiX community give back to the WiX community. Specifically the license requires that fixes and improvements to the WiX toolset must be published using the same license.\par
Sometimes the reciprocal license is incorrectly interpreted to also apply to bundles, packages, and custom actions built using the WiX toolset. The Outercurve Foundation has previously provided this statement below to clarify which now the .NET Foundation reaffirms:\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar The WiX toolset (WiX) is licensed under the Microsoft Reciprocal License (MS-RL). The MS-RL governs the distribution of the software licensed under it, as well as derivative works, and incorporates the definition of a derivative work provided in U.S. copyright law. OuterCurve Foundation (and the .NET Foundation) does not view the installer packages generated by WiX as falling within the definition of a derivative work, merely because they are produced using WiX. Thus, the installer packages generated by WiX will normally fall outside the scope of the MS-RL, and any of your source code, binaries, libraries, routines or other software components that are incorporated in installer packages generated by WiX can be governed by other licensing terms.\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\sa300 The full text of the MS-RL license is reproduced below. It can also be found in the LICENSE.TXT file included with the source code.\par
